# tell_me_console_mac
tell me the console command for every gui interaction with mac system in log type format. 

build plan:
1) what happens in the computer when chrome is executed... <br> Is that an identical but seperate process to terminal `open bin/app`? <br> or does the click actually use that `open filelocation/bin/app` in a background process terminal? 
2)if a background terminal process is kicked off, can that be intercepted and read?
3)if a different process is kicked off can any/all of these processes be read and automatically translated. 
4)is there a way to interact directly with the kernal and have the kernal tell me everything that is going on with terminal commands as a logfile.
